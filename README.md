## Observations and Insights
### (also contained in the first cell of the Jupyter Notebook file)

* Only (1) mouse in the study was discovered to have duplicate data collected for the same Timepoint.  As a result, all the entries for that mouse were removed prior to the overall analysis.

* Capomulin and Ramicane were the (2) "most studied" regimens because recorded the greatest number of total measurements during the study compared with all the others.

* The 248 analyzed for the study had a fairly equal gender distribution so the observations could be logically applied to both Male and Female mice.

* There were no recorded statistical outliers in calculating the final tumor weights in the four "regimens of interest".

* Capomulin and Ramicane are regimens that continue to show promissing results in that the final recorded tumor volume for mice receiving that drug was lower than the two other "regimens of interest" (Infubinol & Ceftamin).

* As expected, a strong correlation was found between the measured weight of a mouse and the average size of their tumor recorded in the study.  A tumor that is a collection of excess cells increased the expected measured weight of the mouse.
